The Simple Network Packet Analyzer is a Python-based tool developed to monitor and analyze network packets in real-time. It provides a basic yet effective way to understand network traffic by capturing and logging packets, offering details such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols used, and packet sizes. This project is ideal for educational purposes, helping users gain insights into network behavior and learn about packet-level analysis. Built using Python, it is lightweight and straightforward to use, requiring minimal setup. While it offers valuable insights into network activity, this tool is intended for ethical use and should only be deployed with proper authorization to avoid violating privacy or security policies.
